                            and cream together in a large bowl for 2 minutes (egg should fall in a thin stream from whisk). Set aside until foam has settled. </li>

                        <li>Heat a 28cm (base) non-stick frying pan over medium heat until hot. Add half the butter and swirl to coat pan base. As last of butter melts, add half the egg mixture. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes or until mixture starts to set. Using a spatula, push set egg towards centre of pan, tilting pan to allow uncooked egg to run over base. Cook for 2 minutes or until eggs form creamy curds. Stir in half the chives. Transfer to a plate. </li>
                        <li>Wipe pan with paper towel. Repeat with remaining butter, egg mixture and chives. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately with toast. </li>

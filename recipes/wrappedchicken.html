                        <dt><b>Brining</b></dt>
                            <dd>Brining is typically a process in which meat is soaked in a salt water solution similar to marination before cooking.[2] Meat is soaked anywhere from 30 minutes to several days. The amount of time needed to brine depends on the size of the meat: more time is needed for a large turkey compared to a broiler fryer chicken. Similarly, a large roast must be brined longer than a thin cut of meat.</dd>
